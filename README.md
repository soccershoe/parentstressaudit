Parent's Stress Audit

The Burnout Baseline: A Modern Parent's Stress Audit

üöÄ Overview

The Burnout Baseline is a single-file web application designed to help working parents quantify their risk of chronic burnout. It goes beyond simple time tracking to measure the cumulative weight of eight critical stressors‚Äîincluding sleep debt, long commutes, emotional labor, and job responsibility‚Äîinto a single metric: the Paternal Schedule Intensity ($\mathbf{PSI_{Score}}$).

The tool provides an immediate score interpretation and targets the user's two highest stress factors, offering actionable advice on where to focus efforts for balance and recovery.

If you are experiencing symptoms of burnout, depression, or severe stress, please consult a qualified healthcare professional or mental health expert.

The scores and advice provided are based on general academic research and should be interpreted as a guide, not a definitive diagnosis.

üìä The PSI Score Calculation (Paternal Schedule Intensity)

The $\mathbf{PSI_{Score}}$ is calculated by summing eight distinct, weighted stress factors. The goal is to establish a score that accurately reflects the total cognitive and physical drain of a modern, busy schedule.

$$\mathbf{PSI_{Score}} = \mathbf{F_S} + \mathbf{F_C} + \mathbf{F_O} + \mathbf{F_J} + \mathbf{F_D} + \mathbf{F_K} + \mathbf{F_G} + \mathbf{F_E}$$

Factor Breakdown

|

| Factor | Description | Calculation Formula | Source Justification |
| $\mathbf{F_S}$ (Sleep Debt) | Stress from inadequate nightly sleep. | $$ \max(0, 7.5 - \text{SleepHours}) \times 10 $$ | Weighting: Penalizes hours below the recommended 7.5 hours, as sleep deprivation compounds all other stressors (Source: Sleep Foundation). |
| $\mathbf{F_C}$ (Commute Strain) | Stress from weekly time lost to long commutes. | $$ \max\left(0, \frac{\text{TotalWeeklyCommuteMinutes} - \text{Days} \times 60}{\text{Days} \times 60}\right) \times 20 $$ | Weighting: Highly weighted (x20) as long commutes (over 60 min RT/day) are strongly linked to high stress and anxiety (Source: Urban Institute/ADP). |
| $\mathbf{F_O}$ (Obligation Load) | Stress from non-core commitments (side gigs, volunteering, extra hobbies). | $$ \max(0, \text{ObligationHours} - 3) \times 4 $$ | Weighting: Penalizes time spent weekly on commitments above a reasonable baseline (3 hours), representing a depletion of personal recovery time. |
| $\mathbf{F_J}$ (Job Load) | Stress from professional responsibility. | $$ \text{JobStressMultiplier} \times 5 $$ | Weighting: Applies a multiplier (Manager=1, Executive=2) because managers report significantly higher burnout rates than individual contributors (Source: Gallup). |
| $\mathbf{F_D}$ (Domestic Load) | Stress from unequal distribution of household chores and mental labor. | $$ \max\left(0, \frac{\text{Chore Share}}{50} - 1\right) \times 15 $$ | Weighting: Highly weighted as unequal domestic labor, particularly the cognitive load (planning, scheduling), is a primary driver of psychological distress in parents (Source: USC Dornsife Research). |
| $\mathbf{F_K}$ (Child Load) | Stress from the cumulative logistical and emotional demands of multiple children. | $$ \max(0, \text{NumKids} - 1) \times 5 $$ | Weighting: Adds a factor for each child after the first, reflecting the exponential increase in logistical demands (Source: Ohio State University Parental Burnout Study). |
| $\mathbf{F_G}$ (Financial Strain) | Stress from job security and monetary worries. | $$ \text{FinancialWorryScore} $$ | Weighting: Directly uses the user's self-reported stress level (1-15), acknowledging financial worry as a chronic, diffuse stressor. |
| $\mathbf{F_E}$ (Energy Mismatch) | Stress from misaligned personality and role demands. | $$ \text{MismatchPenalty} $$ | Weighting: Applies a penalty (up to 10 points) when an Introvert is in a High-Interaction role (like management), which fundamentally drains emotional and mental energy reserves. |

Interpretation Scale

| PSI Score Range | Intensity Level | Meaning |
| 0 - 10 | Low Intensity | Exceptional balance. High recovery time. |
| 11 - 30 | Average Intensity | Typical of a modern working parent. |
| 31 - 50 | High Intensity | Significant chronic stress. Lifestyle adjustments recommended. |
| 51+ | Extreme Intensity | CRITICAL ZONE. Burnout is imminent or present. Immediate, structural changes required. |
