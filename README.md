üìä The PSI Score Calculation (Paternal Schedule Intensity)

The $\mathbf{PSI_{Score}}$ is calculated by summing eight distinct, weighted stress factors. The goal is to establish a score that accurately reflects the total cognitive and physical drain of a moder[...]

$$\mathbf{PSI_{Score}} = \mathbf{F_S} + \mathbf{F_C} + \mathbf{F_O} + \mathbf{F_J} + \mathbf{F_D} + \mathbf{F_K} + \mathbf{F_G} + \mathbf{F_E}$$

### Factor Breakdown

| Factor | Description | Calculation Formula | Source Justification |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| $\mathbf{F_S}$ (Sleep Debt) | Stress from inadequate nightly sleep. | $$ \max(0, 7.5 - \text{SleepHours}) \times 10 $$ | Weighting: Penalizes hours below the recommended 7.5 hours, as sleep deprivat[...]
| $\mathbf{F_C}$ (Commute Strain) | Stress from weekly time lost to long commutes. | $$ \max\left(0, \frac{\text{TotalWeeklyCommuteMinutes} - \text{Days} \times 60}{\text{Days} \times 60}\right) \time[...]
| $\mathbf{F_O}$ (Obligation Load) | Stress from non-core commitments (side gigs, volunteering, extra hobbies). | $$ \max(0, \text{ObligationHours} - 3) \times 4 $$ | Weighting: Penalizes time spent w[...]
| $\mathbf{F_J}$ (Job Load) | Stress from professional responsibility. | $$ \text{JobStressMultiplier} \times 5 $$ | Weighting: Applies a multiplier (Manager=1, Executive=2) because managers report si[...]
| $\mathbf{F_D}$ (Domestic Load) | Stress from unequal distribution of household chores and mental labor. | $$ \max\left(0, \frac{\text{Chore Share}}{50} - 1\right) \times 15 $$ | Weighting: Highly we[...]
| $\mathbf{F_K}$ (Child Load) | Stress from the cumulative logistical and emotional demands of multiple children. | $$ \max(0, \text{NumKids} - 1) \times 5 $$ | Weighting: Adds a factor for each child[...]
| $\mathbf{F_G}$ (Financial Strain) | Stress from job security and monetary worries. | $$ \text{FinancialWorryScore} $$ | Weighting: Directly uses the user's self-reported stress level (1-15), acknowl[...]
| $\mathbf{F_E}$ (Energy Mismatch) | Stress from misaligned personality and role demands. | $$ \text{MismatchPenalty} $$ | Weighting: Applies a penalty (up to 10 points) when an Introvert is in a High[...]

Interpretation Scale

Use the PSI Score to gauge overall stress intensity. The following quick-reference ranges describe typical meaning and recommended actions:

- 0‚Äì10 ‚Äî Low Intensity
  - Meaning: Exceptional balance and ample recovery capacity.
  - What to do: Maintain current routines and continue preventive self-care.

- 11‚Äì30 ‚Äî Average Intensity
  - Meaning: Typical of many working parents; manageable but requires attention.
  - What to do: Keep monitoring sleep and time budgets. Prioritize small, sustainable changes (better sleep hygiene, short breaks, light delegation).

- 31‚Äì50 ‚Äî High Intensity
  - Meaning: Significant chronic stress that is affecting wellbeing.
  - What to do: Consider concrete lifestyle adjustments‚Äîset firmer boundaries, reduce obligations where possible, increase support (partner, family, childcare), and practice regular recovery routines.

- 51+ ‚Äî Extreme Intensity (Critical)
  - Meaning: Burnout is imminent or may already be present.
  - What to do: Immediate structural changes are recommended. Reassess work and home responsibilities, seek professional support (occupational health or mental health professional), and involve close supports to reduce load quickly.

If your score falls in the High or Extreme ranges, consider tracking trends over time (daily/weekly) rather than relying on a single snapshot. Repeated high scores warrant professional evaluation.
